			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				myFlix is a full-stack web application using the MERN stack that enables users to find information on all the Star Wars movies. 
				After signing up, users can add movies to their list of favorites and update their account information as needed.
			</p>
			<h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
			<p>
				I built this project for the CareerFoundry Web Development program to learn about full-stack application development and the variety of technologies needed to do so. 
				myFlix was the first full-stack application I developed, representing a significant milestone in my web development journey.
			</p>
			<h2>Tools</h2>
			<p>
				A MongoDB non-relational database houses all movie and user data, with Mongoose providing structure and access to the database. 
				Node.js and Express were used to write the server-side code and API needed to connect the database to the front-end, which was built with React and styled with React-Bootstrap and SCSS.

		<h2>Approach</h2>
		<div class="server">
			<div class="server-text">
				<h3>Server-Side</h3>
				<p>
					I built a RESTful API to interact with a MongoDB non-relational database that contains data for 10 movies. The API can be accessed with common HTTP methods and sends movie and user data back to the requester in JSON format. 
					Passport was used for HTTP authentication of logins, and upon logging in the user is sent a JSON web token to authorize access to the movie data. Additional data security measures include CORS restrictions, data validation, and hashing of the userâ€™s password. 
					To ensure everything worked as intended, I tested each API endpoint thoroughly using Postman.

				<h3>Client-Side</h3>
				<p>
					With the server-side complete, I moved on to building the user interface. In order to meet the project requirements, I used React to create a single page application with the following views:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Main View: displays each movie as a card with vital information included
					</li>
					<li>
						Movie View: displays all the information for a single movie
					</li>
					<li>
						Profile View: displays user information, favorited movies, and allows the user to update their account information
					</li>
					<li>
						Login View: allows a registered user to login
					</li>
					<li>
						Signup View: allows new users to create an account
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I applied a simple but visually appealing style to the application, utilizing SCSS and React-Bootstrap to create a responsive layout with a dark theme.

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			This was the most challenging yet rewarding project I completed during my CareerFoundry program, as it gave me the opportunity to learn about a variety of tools and techniques that have been essential to my growth as a full-stack developer. 
			The hardest portion for me was creating the profile view, but completing it reinforced the value of approaching a relatively large task (creating a whole view from scratch) by dividing it into a series of smaller tasks in order to achieve the desired result. 
			Overall, I am happy with the end result, thankful for everything I learned throughout the build process, and proud to have completed my first full-stack application.
		</p>
		<h2>Duration</h2>
		<p>
			It took me 2 months to complete the entire project from start to finish, longer than I had originally anticipated. 
			This was due to the amount of time I spent familiarizing myself with the new technologies I used, particularly React, and that I was living in a van and travelling full-time with inconsistent internet access for the duration of the project.
		</p>
		<h2>Future Steps</h2>
		<p>
			If I return to this project, my next steps would be to rebrand the application as a Star Wars-specific repository, add more information about each movie, and add iconic Star Wars shows to the database.
